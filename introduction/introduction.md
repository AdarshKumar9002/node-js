# Node.js Overview

## Q: What is Node.js?

**Ans:** Node.js is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that enables developers to build server-side and network applications with JavaScript. It provides a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js leverages the V8 JavaScript engine and various libraries to extend JavaScript's functionality for server-side programming.

## Q: What is a Runtime Environment?

## History of Node.js

- **Developed by:** Ryan Dahl in 2009.
- **Foundation:** Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Purpose:** Designed to address limitations of traditional web servers, offering an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.
- **npm:** Node Package Manager, hosting over a million packages for easy code reuse.
- **Adoption:** Widely used by companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, and PayPal.

## Why use Node.js?

**Ans:** Node.js offers several advantages:
- **JavaScript Everywhere:** Unified language for client-side and server-side development.
- **Asynchronous and Non-blocking I/O:** Efficient handling of concurrent requests.
- **Rich Ecosystem:** Vast collection of modules and libraries via npm.
- **Fast Execution:** Swift execution of JavaScript code with Chrome's V8 engine.
